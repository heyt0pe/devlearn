  "description": "By Khadija Ismayilova and Nushaba Fatullayeva Novruz Allahverdiyev, 40, lives in a mud house in the village of Chovdar, a small Soviet-era mining town in rural Azerbaijan. He is one of 800,000 displaced persons from the war with Armenia that battered his native Nagorno Karabakh region in the early nineties. He and 60 other families found shelter and a place to farm in the mountainous western region of Dashkesan. Like many of the displaced, Allahverdiyev is patriotic and the walls of his poor home are plastered with pages from an aging calendar featuring portraits of Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan and his late father.",
